Predicting rent of Houses in India 

Problem Statement :
Housing in India varies from palaces of erstwhile maharajas to modern apartment buildings in big cities to tiny huts in far-flung villages. There has been tremendous growth in India's housing sector as incomes have risen.


Algorithms:
 I have used Grid Search method for hyperparameter tuning and I have used Linear Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, KNN, Random forest Regressor for prediction of house Rent .
