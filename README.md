Predicting rent of Houses in India 
Problem Statement :
Housing in India varies from palaces of erstwhile maharajas to modern apartment buildings in big cities to tiny huts in far-flung villages. There has been tremendous growth in India's housing sector as incomes have risen. The Human Rights Measurement Initiative finds that India is doing 60.9% of what should be possible at its level of income for the right to housing.
Algorithms:
 I have used Grid Search method for hyperparameter tuning and I have used Linear Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, KNN, Random forest Regressor .
